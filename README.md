### Make Change Project

#### Description
This program take two inputs form the user, the price of the item and the price the user paid for the item. It then evaluates if the price paid is more or less than the price of the item. If the price paid is less then the price of the item any error message is printed to the screen. If the price paid is the same as the price of the item then no change is given. If the price paid is greater then the item price then the correct change will be given.

#### Lessons learned
I learned a lot from this Project. Because java uses base 2 for floating-point variables they in turn can not accurately represent the base 10 multiples that we use for money. I also got practice using

#### Techniques used
I got a lot of practice using System.err.print() to diagnose problems in my code. Declaring methods and passing values into them. Utilizing a scanner to take input for the user. Using loops and if statements.
